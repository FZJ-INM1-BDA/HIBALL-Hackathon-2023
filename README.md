# HIBALL-Hackathon-2023

On the occasion of OHBM annual conference we will organize a HIBALL Hackathon on July 27, right after OHBM. 
All of you who will be in Montreal are welcome to join us for a constructive and productive day around BigBrain 
data, maps, models, and tools. We will offer time and space for small collaborative projects that you would like 
to work on with other HIBALL team members.

üí° Feel free to start a rough description of your idea as a new git issue and discuss with potential collaborators.
